Full Stack = Front End + Back End
		= client languages + server side
Persistence = saving things

Back end == Server side
-talk to the server
-read/write files and database
-accept  requests from users
	GET = download request
	POST = upload request
-validation, save something or retrieve something
-determine the appropriate response
	200 OK (server accepted the request and hold on)
	404 error - page not found
	500 erros -server side erros
PHP -PHP the Hypertext Preprocessor 
	(all of our serverside languages are assembling the html that is delivered in our browser)
	(PHP and HTML are supposed to blend together)
	assembles HTML with variables 

security flaws (but if we do everything in curriculum then we will overpass the lion's share of them)

In JavaScript and PHP syntax is the same for 
operators 
if, switch
while, dowhile,
functions

Steps to enable interactive mode:
cd ~/vagrant-lamp/
vagrant status
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
php -a from your vagrant box

' '= literal
" "= not literal, it would add

"" = figure out if there's a meaning behind something but not single quotes 
all variables in php start with a dollar sign 


var _dump ($result);

is a more powerful tool than console.log
